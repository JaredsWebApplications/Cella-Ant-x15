# Cella-Ant-x15

A cellular automaton (Cella) variant of Langton's Ant written in Javascript and P5JS for CS 335.

## Structure

- master (working branch and should not be pushed to from individual branches)
    * devbranch (development branch were we test out code from each contributor)
        + [name]branch (your individual branch/workspace)

This is the hierarchy that we should follow to efficiently create this project and delegate tasks
