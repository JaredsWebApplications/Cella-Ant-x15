\subsection{Mason Godfrey}
\begin{enumerate}
\item This sprint, I fixed some logic behind our ant that made the ant move incorrectly on the y axis. I also fixed the fact that the ant was moving before updating the new square as opposed to updating the old square before moving, and commented code
\item Next, I plan to help my team members add animation to the ant
\item As of now, nothing is blocking further progress on the project
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Jared Dyreson}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I have worked on improving the stability of the code we wrote, moved some constants to be encapsulated by the grid constructor and overall readability. I have also started working on comment headers to describe each function of each file and their respective authors
\item I plan to finish the Big O Analysis and move the position of the grid generation
\item There are no roadblocks in the foreseeable future
\end{enumerate}
