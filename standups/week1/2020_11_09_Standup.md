# Standup

## Mason Godfrey

Q1) This sprint, I fixed some logic behind our ant that made the ant move incorrectly on the y axis. I also fixed the fact that the ant was moving before updating the new square as opposed to updating the old square before moving, and commented code.

Q2) Next, I plan to help my team members add animation to the ant.

Q3) As of now, nothing is blocking further progress on the project.

## Jared Dyreson

Q1) I have worked on improving the stability of the code we wrote, moved some constants to be encapsulated by the grid constructor and overall readability. I have also started working on comment headers to describe each function of each file and their respective authors.

Q2) I plan to finish the Big O Analysis and move the position of the grid generation.

Q3) There are no roadblocks in the foreseeable future
