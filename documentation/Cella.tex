\section{Big-O Analysis}

Our implementation of Cella Ant runs in at $O(n^2)$ time for the initial setup, as we need to create a grid on which the Ant resides on.
After the first draw, the program will have a time efficiency of $O(1)$, as we're only accessing a specific element in a 2 x 2 matrix.
This however does not imply that it only takes on instruction.
The evaluation depends on the notion that the algorithm depends on a fixed number of instructions and the most general case is in fact $O(1)$.


One of the critical points we needed to address was the direction in which the ant was going to take.
Thankfully there was a quick solution from bit manipulation, which has an efficiency of $O(1)$.
The code snippet is seen below:

\begin{lstlisting}
var antDir = (this.hex % (32 >> cellState)) >> (4 - cellState);
\end{lstlisting}

The time efficiency is only $O(1)$ because it simply relies on a constant "cellState", which helps go to the specific bit index of 0x15.
